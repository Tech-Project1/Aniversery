    <h1>My Love Letter to You</h1>
    <p>I donâ€™t even know where to begin  not because I donâ€™t have words, but because I have too many. Every time I try to explain how much you mean to me, I fall short. How do you describe something that feels like the whole universe in one person?</p>

    <p>You walked into my life and flipped it upside down in the best way possible. I didnâ€™t know what real peace was until I met you. I didnâ€™t know what it meant to feel seen, really seen, until I looked into your eyes. And now, I donâ€™t want to imagine a single day without you in it.</p>

    <p>You're not just Great you're Perfect for me.And i want you to be open with me, I want you to tell me everything and most important of all i want you to be yourself even if your too clingy i like clingy.</p>

    <p>Some nights I lay in bed just thinking about how lucky I am. You didnâ€™t just save me from life, you pulled me out of a storm I didnâ€™t even know I was in. You gave me peace when all I knew was chaos. You gave me hope when I was tired of hoping.</p>

    <p>Even in silence, I feel full when youâ€™re next to me. You donâ€™t even have to say anything your presence alone feels like home. Thatâ€™s what you are: my home. My calm. My best friend. My person. The loml.</p>

    <p>The hardest times is when i have to say goodbye and not talk or see you for hours on end, it feels like i lose a part of myself it doesnt feel the same. You have grown into a person that i can't imagine living without.</p>

    <p>If I could, Iâ€™d take all the love I feel and bottle it, just so you could hold it in your hands and see how real, how deep, how endless it truly is. I wish you could live one day in my heart, just to understand how much space you take up in it.</p>

    <p>I never felt right with anyone else, I never felt like i was worth something like i meant something but with you i feel completed i feel like i had lost the other part of me i never knew existed.</p>

    <p>So thank you for choosing me. For trusting me. For loving someone who still struggles to love himself sometimes. I donâ€™t take a single moment with you for granted. Not one.</p>

    <p>I promise to always remind you how loved you are. To listen when youâ€™re quiet and hold you when you need strength. I promise to cheer for you, believe in you, and love you with everything I am. Always.</p>

    <p>You deserve the entire world, and Iâ€™ll spend my life trying to give it to you piece by piece, day by day, moment by moment.</p>

    <p>I would write more reasons but i have to leave some for the handmade letter so please always remember that i love you and will never leave you even if god offerd me a wish.</p>
    <p>You are my heart. My pretty little princess. My Love.</p>
    <p>ðŸ’– Forever yours.</p>
     <p>loveyou</p>
